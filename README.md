# Flip's Little Adventure
Flip's Little Adventure(FLA) is a game for Casio Prizm calculators. It features turn-based combat with Action commands and roguelike-ish character progression.
The development is currently far from complete.

# Gameplay
FLA's gameplay consists of two parts: Combat and Upgrade. You are engaged in combat first. After beating enemies, you pick random bonus as a reward. Rinse and repeat to engage with tougher enemies while improving your character, Flip.

### Combat
Combat is turn-based, you attack and then enemies attack. You can select one from three commands: Jump, Dive, Defense. Jump and Dive are different types of attack. On contact with enemies, press [EXE] button for more damage. Similarly, when enemies attack, you can press [EXE] to defend.
After stage 2, you earn Spell Cards. You can play one spell every turn, and used spells cannot be used again for the rest of the combat. If you have more than 3 spells, three of them are randomly drawn from your "Spell deck" and you can choose one. If you have many spell cards, it might be hard to get the one you want, so the game provides you unique bonuses depending on how many cards you have.

### Upgrade
After the combat, you can upgrade your character. You can choose one option out of three. Upgrade options can be Passive or Spell. Passive give you permanent power, while Spells are added to your Deck and you can use it in combat.
Also, certain stages have bonus objective, which gives you unique upgrades if fulfilled.

### Stat
Flip and enemies have stats.
- Attack: Increases the amount of damage you deal.
- Defense: Decreases the amount of damage you take.
- Speed: Increases the chance of Extra turn. Certain spells work better if your speed is faster.

You can increase your stats using "Level up" upgrades. Certain spells can change stats temporarily.
