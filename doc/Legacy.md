# Legacy

FLA is a remake of DestroyB, which is a game created around 2006. It was deleted due to calculator error. DestroyB's gameplay was inspired by many video games I played then.

The game is divided into two parts: production and battle. In production part, you earn money by repeatedly pressing a button and spend them for units and upgrades. Combat is turn-based, with action commands.

I tried to remake this game for many years. From 2012, I came with many ideas, and tried to improve some aspects of this game.

- The theme

DestroyB was a game where you protect your castle, but it only felt like Jumpers vs Enemies. Your team only had one health bar, and you only attacked with Jumpers.
The new design was either drop the castle theme, or add mechanics involving the castle. After a lot of design changes, FLA removed castle altogether.

- Customization
The production part was inspired by real-time strategy games, namely Starcraft. You train workers to earn more money, and train attack units or upgrade for combat. The system allows you to customize, but because of the battle system, your options were shallow.
Also, how would you earn money? In DestroyB you mashed a button. That's not fun. More complex minigames might be good there, but I couldn't come up with compelling one so I'm trying roguelike progression in FLA.
